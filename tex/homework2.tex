1.2 - since smallOverlap was the same, took half the data for test and half for train



2.2: 
* do training set over some values of lambda
* use that to pick lambda
* test on `validation' data and report an error value

2.3:
will need to plot lambda versus sparsity

2.4:
* do training set over some values of bandwidth with lambda = 0
* do validation set over some values of lambda
* test on test and report results

2.5:
* will need to think about this a little bit more.

* L2 regularization, linear case

* maybe need to save coefficients or predictions or something?
